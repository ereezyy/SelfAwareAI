# Bot Architecture Outline

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the architecture for a sophisticated bot designed for collaborative coding, text humanization, and AI-generated text detection. The bot will feature self-awareness, self-healing, and self-coding capabilities.

## 2. Core Modules
The bot will be composed of the following core modules:

### 2.1. Self-Awareness Module (`self_aware_module.py`)
- **Purpose**: To monitor the bot's internal state, resource usage (CPU, memory, disk), and operational health.
- **Features**:
    - Logging of critical events and errors.
    - Introspection capabilities to report its status.
    - Basic health checks for other modules.
- **Dependencies**: `psutil` for system metrics, `logging`.

### 2.2. Self-Healing and Self-Coding Module (`self_healing_coding_module.py`)
- **Purpose**: To enable the bot to detect issues, attempt recovery, and modify its own codebase or configurations based on commands or detected needs.
- **Features (Self-Healing)**:
    - Error detection hooks.
    - Predefined recovery strategies (e.g., restarting a module, reloading configuration).
    - Reporting unrecoverable errors to the Self-Awareness module.
- **Features (Self-Coding)**:
    - Ability to analyze code structure (e.g., identify functions, classes).
    - Apply simple code patches (string replacement, line additions/deletions).
    - Modify configuration files (e.g., JSON).
    - Execute Python scripts dynamically.
- **Dependencies**: `ast` (for code analysis, if advanced), `json`, `subprocess`, `logging`.

### 2.3. Command Interface Module (`command_interface.py`)
- **Purpose**: To provide a text-based interface for users to interact with the bot, issue commands for coding, text processing, and other functions.
- **Features**:
    - Command parsing and validation.
    - Dispatching commands to appropriate handlers/modules.
    - Formatting and returning results to the user.
    - Help command to list available commands and their usage.
- **Dependencies**: `shlex` (for command parsing), `inspect` (for help command), `logging`.

### 2.4. Text Humanization Module (`text_humanization_module.py`)
- **Purpose**: To modify input text to make it sound more natural or human-like.
- **Features**:
    - Paraphrasing text using pre-trained language models.
    - Configurable parameters for humanization intensity/style (e.g., number of beams, temperature).
- **Dependencies**: `transformers`, `torch`, `sentencepiece`, `sacremoses`, `protobuf`, `logging`.
- **Selected Model**: `tuner007/pegasus_paraphrase` (or similar, based on availability and performance).

### 2.5. AI Text Detection Module (`ai_text_detection_module.py`)
- **Purpose**: To analyze input text and predict whether it was generated by an AI or written by a human.
- **Features**:
    - Classification using pre-trained language models.
    - Reporting a probability score for the classification.
- **Dependencies**: `transformers`, `torch`, `logging`.
- **Selected Model**: `AICodexLab/answerdotai-ModernBERT-base-ai-detector` (with documented limitations regarding potential over-prediction of AI-generated text).

## 3. Module Interactions
- The **Command Interface** is the primary entry point for user requests. It will delegate tasks to other modules.
- The **Self-Awareness Module** will monitor all other modules and its own health. It can be queried by the Command Interface for status reports.
- The **Self-Healing/Coding Module** can be invoked by the Command Interface (for coding tasks) or triggered by the Self-Awareness module (for healing tasks).
- The **Text Humanization Module** and **AI Text Detection Module** will be called by the Command Interface when their respective functionalities are requested.
- All modules will use the `logging` module to record their activities and errors. Log files will be managed centrally or per module.

## 4. Data Flow and Storage
- **User Input**: Received by the Command Interface as text strings.
- **Intermediate Data**: Processed within modules. For example, code analysis results, paraphrased text, detection scores.
- **Output**: Formatted text responses sent back to the user via the Command Interface.
- **Configuration**: Bot-wide or module-specific configurations might be stored in JSON files (e.g., model names, logging levels).
- **Code Storage**: The bot's own source code files (`.py`) are stored in the filesystem.
- **Log Storage**: Log files will be stored in the `/home/ubuntu/` directory (e.g., `bot_main.log`, `bot_command_interface.log`, etc.).

## 5. Primary Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.11
- **Key Libraries/Frameworks**:
    - `transformers` (for NLP models)
    - `torch` (deep learning framework, dependency for transformers)
    - `psutil` (for system monitoring)
    - `shlex` (for command parsing)
    - `logging` (for event logging)
    - `json` (for configuration and data exchange)
    - `subprocess` (for running external scripts/commands)
    - `inspect` (for dynamic help generation)
    - `sentencepiece`, `sacremoses`, `protobuf` (dependencies for specific transformer models)

## 6. Development and Testing Strategy
- Each module will be developed and unit-tested independently.
- Integration testing will be performed as modules are combined.
- The Command Interface will serve as the primary tool for end-to-end testing.
- Test cases will cover normal operation, error conditions, and edge cases.
- Accuracy of Text Humanization and AI Detection will be assessed with sample texts, and limitations will be documented.

## 7. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Initial Build)
- More sophisticated self-healing strategies (e.g., automated rollback of faulty code changes).
- Advanced self-coding (e.g., generating new functions based on specifications).
- GUI interface.
- Persistent memory/database for long-term learning or state.
