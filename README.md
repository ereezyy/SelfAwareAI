## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `bot_config.json` to customize:

```json
{
  "bot_name": "Your Bot Name",
  "modules": {
    "text_humanizer": {"enabled": true},
    "ai_detector": {"enabled": true}
  }
}
```

## üìä Performance & Monetization

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: Moderate (spikes during AI processing)
- **Memory**: 2-4GB (depending on active models)
- **Storage**: ~2GB (cached models)

### Business Model Opportunities
1. **SaaS API Service** - Offer text humanization/detection as paid API
2. **Enterprise Integration** - Custom bot deployments for businesses
3. **Content Tools** - White-label solutions for content creators
4. **Academic Tools** - AI detection services for educational institutions

## üîí Security & Compliance

- All processing runs locally (no data sent to external APIs)
- Configurable logging levels for compliance requirements
- File system access controls for enterprise deployments
- GDPR-friendly (no external data transmission)

## üìà Scaling & Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python3", "bot_launcher.py"]
```

### API Service Mode
The bot can be easily extended to run as a REST API using Flask/FastAPI for commercial deployment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### AI Text Detection
- Model may misclassify human text as AI-generated (especially short/informal text)
- Best used as a screening tool, not definitive judgment
- Accuracy varies by text length and complexity

### Self-Healing
- Limited to predefined error recovery strategies
- Cannot fix all types of system issues automatically
- Requires manual intervention for complex problems

## üîÑ Updates & Maintenance

The bot includes self-monitoring and can report its health status:

```bash
python3 bot_launcher.py --health-check
```

## üìã License

This project is released under the Unlicense (public domain).

## ü§ù Support & Development

- Check logs in `/home/ubuntu/` for troubleshooting
- Use `status` command for real-time health monitoring
- All modules are independently testable
- Modular architecture allows easy feature additions
