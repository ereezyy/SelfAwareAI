# Final Report: Self-Aware, Self-Healing, Self-Coding Bot

## 1. Introduction

This report details the development of a sophisticated bot designed with capabilities for self-awareness, self-healing, self-coding, collaborative coding via a command interface, text humanization, and AI-generated text detection. The project aimed to create a robust and extensible platform that can assist users in coding tasks while also managing its own operational integrity and providing advanced text processing features.

## 2. Bot Architecture

The bot is built upon a modular architecture, with each core functionality encapsulated in a separate Python module. This design promotes maintainability, scalability, and independent development of features. The primary modules are:

*   **`self_aware_module.py`**: Monitors the bot's operational status, system resources (CPU, memory, disk), and the health of other modules. It provides logging and introspection capabilities.
*   **`self_healing_coding_module.py`**: Contains two main classes:
    *   `SelfHealingModule`: Detects errors within the bot's operations and attempts predefined recovery strategies. It can handle common issues like `ImportError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `SyntaxError`, etc.
    *   `SelfCodingModule`: Provides functionalities for analyzing Python code structure (identifying functions, classes, imports), applying simple code patches (string replacements), and modifying parameters in JSON configuration files.
*   **`command_interface.py`**: Serves as the primary interaction point for the user. It parses user commands, dispatches them to the appropriate modules, and returns results. This module integrates all other modules to provide a unified user experience.
*   **`text_humanization_module.py`**: Utilizes a pre-trained transformer model (specifically, `Ateeqq/Text-Rewriter-Paraphraser` from Hugging Face) to paraphrase and rephrase input text, aiming to make it sound more natural or human-like.
*   **`ai_text_detection_module.py`**: Employs a pre-trained transformer model (`AICodexLab/answerdotai-ModernBERT-base-ai-detector` from Hugging Face) to classify input text as either human-written or AI-generated.

An initial architecture outline was also created: `bot_architecture_outline.md`.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1. Self-Awareness

The `SelfAwareModule` continuously monitors:
*   Bot uptime.
*   System resource usage (CPU, memory, disk).
*   Health status of other registered modules.
*   It logs significant events and provides a `status` command through the interface for users to query the bot's current state.

### 3.2. Self-Healing

The `SelfHealingModule` is integrated with other modules (primarily the `CommandInterface`) to catch exceptions. When an error occurs, it attempts to:
*   Identify the error type.
*   Apply a relevant recovery strategy (e.g., suggest package installation for `ImportError`, attempt to create missing directories for `FileNotFoundError`).
*   Log the error and the outcome of the recovery attempt.

### 3.3. Self-Coding

The `SelfCodingModule` enables the bot to interact with and modify code and configuration files through commands like:
*   `analyze_code <filepath>`: Reports functions, classes, and imports in a Python file.
*   `patch_code <filepath> "<old_string>" "<new_string>"`: Performs a simple string replacement in a file.
*   `modify_config <config_filepath> <parameter_key> <new_json_value>`: Changes a value in a JSON configuration file.

### 3.4. Collaborative Coding Command Interface

The `CommandInterface` (`command_interface.py`) is the central hub for user interaction. It supports a range of commands, including:
*   File operations: `create_file`, `read_file`, `update_file_content`, `append_to_file`.
*   Script execution: `run_python_script`.
*   Bot status and help: `status`, `help`.
*   Coding assistance: `analyze_code`, `patch_code`, `modify_config`.
*   Text processing: `humanize_text`, `detect_ai_text`.

It includes robust command parsing and error handling, and logs all interactions.

### 3.5. Text Humanization

The `TextHumanizer` module uses the `Ateeqq/Text-Rewriter-Paraphraser` model to offer text paraphrasing. The `humanize_text "<text>"` command provides alternative phrasings of the input text.

### 3.6. AI Text Detection

The `AITextDetectorModule` uses the `AICodexLab/answerdotai-ModernBERT-base-ai-detector` model. The `detect_ai_text "<text>"` command returns probabilities of the text being human-written versus AI-generated.

**Important Limitation**: During testing, this AI detection model (`AICodexLab/answerdotai-ModernBERT-base-ai-detector`) showed a tendency to classify human-written text, particularly shorter or less formal pieces, as AI-generated with high confidence. This limitation is explicitly mentioned in the `help` command output and in the response of the `detect_ai_text` command. Users should interpret its results with caution.

## 4. Setup and Usage

To run the bot and use its command-line interface:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed.
2.  **Dependencies**: The bot requires several Python packages. These were installed during development using pip:
    *   `psutil` (for self-awareness module)
    *   `transformers` (for text humanization and AI detection)
    *   `torch` (PyTorch, a dependency for transformers)
    *   `sentencepiece` (for some transformer models)
    *   `sacremoses` (for some transformer models)
    You can typically install these via pip: `pip3 install psutil transformers torch sentencepiece sacremoses`.
    *Note: The `transformers` library will download model files (which can be several hundred MBs each) on the first run of the `TextHumanizer` and `AITextDetector` modules if they are not already cached.*
3.  **Running the Bot**: Navigate to the directory containing all the `.py` files and execute the command interface script:
    ```bash
    python3.11 command_interface.py
    ```
    This will start an interactive command-line session where you can issue commands to the bot. The script also runs a series of internal tests upon startup to demonstrate functionality.
4.  **Available Commands**: Type `help` in the bot's command interface to see a list of available commands and their basic usage.
5.  **Log Files**: The bot generates several log files in the `/home/ubuntu/` directory (or the directory from which it's run if permissions differ):
    *   `bot_self_aware.log`
    *   `bot_self_healing_coding.log`
    *   `bot_command_interface.log`
    *   `bot_text_humanization.log`
    *   `bot_ai_detection.log`

## 5. Development Process Summary

The development followed an iterative process:
1.  **Architecture Outline**: Defined the overall structure and modules.
2.  **Module Implementation**: Developed each module (`self_aware_module.py`, `self_healing_coding_module.py`, `text_humanization_module.py`, `ai_text_detection_module.py`) with placeholder/mock functionality initially, then fleshed out with actual logic and external library integrations.
3.  **Command Interface Integration**: Built `command_interface.py` to tie all modules together and provide user interaction.
4.  **Dependency Management**: Installed necessary Python packages (`psutil`, `transformers`, `torch`, etc.) as required by the modules.
5.  **Testing and Debugging**: Each module and the integrated system were tested. This involved:
    *   Unit tests embedded within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` blocks of each module.
    *   Integration tests run from `command_interface.py` to ensure modules worked together.
    *   Iterative debugging to fix syntax errors (e.g., f-string issues), import errors, and logic errors.
    *   Addressing sandbox resets by recreating files and reinstalling dependencies.
6.  **AI Model Selection**: Researched and selected Hugging Face models for text humanization and AI detection. Addressed issues with model loading and output interpretation.
7.  **Limitation Discovery and Documentation**: Identified and documented the tendency of the AI text detection model to misclassify human text.

## 6. Known Limitations and Future Work

*   **AI Text Detection Accuracy**: As mentioned, the current AI text detection model has limitations and may not always be accurate, especially with nuanced or short human text. Further research into more robust models or fine-tuning existing ones could improve this.
*   **Self-Healing Scope**: The self-healing capabilities are currently based on predefined handlers for common errors. More sophisticated AI-driven error diagnosis and automated code correction could be explored.
*   **Self-Coding Complexity**: The self-coding features are basic (string replacement, JSON modification). Advanced capabilities like AST-based refactoring or generating new code blocks based on high-level descriptions would be significant enhancements.
*   **Resource Intensive Models**: The transformer models for text humanization and AI detection can be resource-intensive (CPU, memory, disk space for model download). For constrained environments, lighter models or API-based services might be considered.
*   **Security**: Running arbitrary Python scripts (`run_python_script`) and modifying files carry inherent security risks. In a production environment, sandboxing and strict permission controls would be crucial.
*   **User Interface**: The current interface is command-line based. A graphical user interface (GUI) or web interface could enhance usability.

## 7. Conclusion

The developed bot successfully integrates features for self-awareness, self-healing, self-coding, text humanization, and AI text detection. It provides a functional command-line interface for users to leverage these capabilities. While there are areas for future improvement, particularly regarding the accuracy of AI text detection and the sophistication of self-coding, the current system serves as a solid foundation for a highly autonomous and intelligent coding assistant.
