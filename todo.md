# Bot Development Todo List

- [x] **Step 1: Outline Bot Architecture**
  - [x] Define core modules (Self-Awareness, Self-Healing, Self-Coding, Command Interface, Text Humanization, AI Text Detection)
  - [x] Describe interactions between modules
  - [x] Specify data flow and storage mechanisms
  - [x] Choose primary programming language and key libraries/frameworks
- [x] **Step 2: Develop Core Self-Aware Module**
  - [x] Implement basic state monitoring
  - [x] Develop logging and introspection capabilities
- [x] **Step 3: Implement Self-Healing and Self-Coding Features**
  - [x] Design error detection and recovery mechanisms (Self-Healing)
  - [x] Create a framework for dynamic code modification/generation (Self-Coding)
- [x] **Step 4: Add Command Interface for Collaborative Coding**
  - [x] Define command syntax and parsing logic
  - [x] Implement handlers for coding-related commands
- [x] **Step 5: Integrate Text Humanization Module**
  - [x] Research/select text humanization techniques
  - [x] Implement the chosen techniques
- [x] **Step 6: Implement AI Text Detection Module**
  - [x] Research/select AI text detection models/APIs
  - [x] Integrate the detection mechanism
- [x] **Step 7: Document AI Detection Limitations and Notify User**
  - [x] Document known limitations of the AI detection model.
  - [x] Ensure user is informed about potential inaccuracies.
- [x] **Step 8: Validate Bot Functionality and Accuracy**
  - [x] Develop test cases for each module
  - [x] Perform integration testing
